      "ID: 101005297116, Description: Cars are parking illegally on a daily basis. The corner of Van Winkle St and Magdala St in Dorchester (02124) has a parking area for visitors on Magdala St. The sign states parking for two hours at a time is allowed. Residents and non-residents (without parking permits/stickers) are parking here all day. Some head for the red line T and return after an apparent working day. Those of us who have genuine visitors find that the visitors have no legal parking due to cars that are in the visitor spot for many hours or all day. While there seems to be occasional parking enforcement on Van Winkle St, there is no consequence for those parking illegally in the visitor parking area. Could someone please attempt to enforce the parking rules here.\n",
